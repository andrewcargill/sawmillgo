## System Overview

### Introduction
The system is designed to manage items such as trees, logs, or planks, categorized as either verified or unverified. A verified item can be traced back to its origin (the tree), while an unverified item (log or plank) cannot. Understanding this concept is crucial before using the system as it plays a core role in how items are viewed, managed, and assigned.

Only verified items can generate our unique 100% transparent reports for your end customers. The system automatically handles the distinction behind the scenes.

### System Overview
Our goal was to create an intuitive system that simplifies tracking trees, logs, and planks. Much of the work occurs behind the scenes to ensure you always know what stock you have and where it is located. By storing each step of a treeâ€™s journey to the end customer, you have access to accurate and detailed data.

The system focuses on the verified path from trees to end products, but also allows for seamless management of unverified logs and planks. The process includes:

1. **Tree:** We document the story of where the tree stood, reasons and timing for its removal, and details about who removed it.
2. **Log:** Each logged tree is entered into the system with details like date, length, and diameter recorded.
3. **Plank:** In the sawmill, each milled log is recorded with information on grade, possible use, images, date, and operator.
4. **Moisture Content:** Records of the moisture content for each plank are maintained over time.

### Interwoven Sub-Systems
- **Projects:** Manage the availability of a tree, log, or plank. Projects include details on allocated items, start date, deadline, and project information.
- **End Reports:** Generated from projects to provide the final report for the customer.
- **Locations:** Manage where each item is stored, including forest areas, drying areas, or sawmill processing/storage locations.
- **Users:** Store information about system users, their roles, and their activities, such as creating and modifying records.


### Gloabl settings
### Sawmill profile (coming soon)
Here you can create a homepage sharing your unique story and how you manage and source for wood.
### UserProfile
Every user must have a username. A user can also add a user image and be allocated to specific rolls within the system. 

### Species
Here we set tree species that you will use within your system. You will need to add at least one species of tree before you can start adding items to the system. 

### Locations
Here we set various locations where any item might be stored. The movement between these locations is stored to ensure that you can find any item with ease. Locations are also feature part of the end report of verified projects. 

### Projects
Here we set up projects. Projects are how we manage the status of any item within the system. An item can have a status of 'available, reserved and sold' and it's status is set automatically depending on the allocated projects status. You do not need an project to start using the system. Important! A project is strictly set to manage ONLY verified or unverified items. This is because verified reports are created via projects.
