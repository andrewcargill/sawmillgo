## System Overview

### Introduction
The system is designed to manage items such as trees, logs, or planks, categorized as either verified or unverified. A verified item can be traced back to its origin (the tree), while an unverified item (log or plank) cannot. Understanding this concept is crucial before using the system as it plays a core role in how items are viewed, managed, and assigned.

Only verified items can generate our unique 100% transparent reports for your end customers. The system automatically handles the distinction behind the scenes.

### System Overview
Our goal was to create an intuitive system that simplifies tracking trees, logs, and planks. Much of the work occurs behind the scenes to ensure you always know what stock you have and where it is located. By storing each step of a treeâ€™s journey to the end customer, you have access to accurate and detailed data.

The system focuses on the verified path from trees to end products, but also allows for seamless management of unverified logs and planks. The process includes:

1. **Tree:** We document the story of where the tree stood, reasons and timing for its removal, and details about who removed it.
2. **Log:** Each logged tree is entered into the system with details like date, length, and diameter recorded.
3. **Plank:** In the sawmill, each milled log is recorded with information on grade, possible use, images, date, and operator.
4. **Moisture Content:** Records of the moisture content for each plank are maintained over time.

### Interwoven Sub-Systems
- **Projects:** Manage the availability of a tree, log, or plank. Projects include details on allocated items, start date, deadline, and project information.
- **End Reports:** Generated from projects to provide the final report for the customer.
- **Locations:** Manage where each item is stored, including forest areas, drying areas, or sawmill processing/storage locations.
- **Users:** Store information about system users, their roles, and their activities, such as creating and modifying records.


## Global Settings

### Sawmill Profile (Coming Soon)
This section will allow you to create a homepage to share your unique story about how you manage and source wood.

### UserProfile
Every user must have a username. Additionally, users can upload a profile image and be assigned specific roles within the system.

### Species
This setting allows you to define the tree species used within your system. You must add at least one species of tree before you can begin adding items.

### Locations
Configure various storage locations for any item. The system tracks movements between these locations to simplify item retrieval. These locations are also included in the end reports of verified projects.

### Projects
Projects are used to manage the status of items within the system. An item can be marked as 'available,' 'reserved,' or 'sold,' with its status automatically updated based on the associated project's status. Note: It is not necessary to have a project in order to use the system. However, projects are designated to manage either ONLY verified or unverified items, as verified reports are generated through projects.
