## System OverView

### Introduction
The system is designed to manage items (a tree, log or plank)  that are verified and unverified. Verified is an item can be traced to it's origins (the tree). Unverified is an item (log or plank) that cannot be traced to its origins (a tree).
It is important to understand this concept before beginning to use the system as it plays a core roll in how you see, manage and assign items within the system. 

Verfied items are the only ones that generate our unique 100% transparent reports that you can pass onto your end customer. Unverified items cannot be used to generate report. The system takes care of all of this behind the scenes. yst

### Overview
The aim was to create a system that is intuative to use and that makes the task of tracking trees, logs and planks extremly simple. Behind the scenes is where much of the work is taking place to ensure that you always know what stock you have and where you can find it. This is the great thing about having the goal to create a 100% transparent and tracable path for your end customers, we need to store the journey of the tree to the end customer, meaning you have access to accurate and detailed data on every step of that journey.

We will focus on the verified path from trees to an end product, but please note the system is designed so that you can add and manage unverified logs and planks in a seemless way. The process is broken down into: 

step 1. Tree.  This is where we tell the story of where the tree stood, why and when it was removed and by who. 
step 2. Log. When you log the tree you enter each log into the system. We record the date, length and diameter. 
step 3. Plank. In the sawmill you mill your log. You add a record for each plank produced. Here we hold information such as grade, possible use, images, date and operator. 
step 4. Moisture content. Each plank can hold records of the moisture content over time. 

Interweaved sub-systems
Projects. Here you manage the avaliablity of a tree, log or plank. A project holds information on the items allocated to it along with start date, deadline, project information. 
End Reports. These are generated via projects and create the end report for the customer.
Locations. You create locations where a tree, log or plank will be stored. This can be areas of the forest, drying areas or sawmill processing / storage. 
Users. Users are those that will use your system. Thier information is stored when they create new items or modify records. 




### Gloabl settings
### Sawmill profile (coming soon)
Here you can create a homepage sharing your unique story and how you manage and source for wood.
### UserProfile
Every user must have a username. A user can also add a user image and be allocated to specific rolls within the system. 

### Species
Here we set tree species that you will use within your system. You will need to add at least one species of tree before you can start adding items to the system. 

### Locations
Here we set various locations where any item might be stored. The movement between these locations is stored to ensure that you can find any item with ease. Locations are also feature part of the end report of verified projects. 

### Projects
Here we set up projects. Projects are how we manage the status of any item within the system. An item can have a status of 'available, reserved and sold' and it's status is set automatically depending on the allocated projects status. You do not need an project to start using the system. Important! A project is strictly set to manage ONLY verified or unverified items. This is because verified reports are created via projects.
