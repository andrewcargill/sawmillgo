# Help Document for Sawmill Go System

## 1. Introduction
### Purpose of the Document
This document is designed to guide you through the features and functionalities of the Sawmill Go system.

### System Overview
Sawmill Go offers an easy-to-use complete stock management system that tracks trees into logs and through to planks. It includes detailed management of storage locations, drying data, and project assignments.
Sawmill Go provides a complete story from forest to end product, including:
- A location map of where the tree stood.
- Detailed reports and information from every step of the journey.
- A creators' section featuring images of products in production.

Our goal was to create an intuitive system that simplifies tracking trees, logs, and planks. Much of the work occurs behind the scenes to ensure you always know what stock you have and where it is located. By storing each step of a treeâ€™s journey to the end customer, you have access to accurate and detailed data.

The system focuses on the verified path from trees to end products, but also allows for seamless management of unverified logs and planks. The process includes:

1. **Tree:** We document the story of where the tree stood, reasons and timing for its removal, and details about who removed it.
2. **Log:** Each logged tree is entered into the system with details like date, length, and diameter recorded.
3. **Plank:** In the sawmill, each milled log is recorded with information on grade, possible use, images, date, and operator.
4. **Moisture Content:** Records of the moisture content for each plank are maintained over time.

### Interwoven Sub-Systems
- **Projects:** Manage the availability of a tree, log, or plank. Projects include details on allocated items, start date, deadline, and project information.
- **End Reports:** Generated from projects to provide the final report for the customer.
- **Locations:** Manage where each item is stored, including forest areas, drying areas, or sawmill processing/storage locations.
- **Users:** Store information about system users, their roles, and their activities, such as creating and modifying records.



## 2. Getting Started
### System Requirements
The Sawmill Go system is 100% cloud based. The system is accessable via user login and will function on all devices.

### Installation Guide
You will be issued with a master-user account login. From here you can set up the following:
- **Users:** Add users and enable them to create user profiles. 
- **Species:** Add the tree speices you will be working with (This can be added - but species cannot be removed)
- **Locations:** Add various locations where you will be removing trees, storing logs and drying timber. 

### Initial Setup
### Sawmill Profile (Coming Soon)
This section will allow you to create a homepage to share your unique story about how you manage and source wood.

### UserProfile
Every user must have a username. Additionally, users can upload a profile image and be assigned specific roles within the system.

### Species
This setting allows you to define the tree species used within your system. You must add at least one species of tree before you can begin adding items.

### Locations
Configure various storage locations for any item. The system tracks movements between these locations to simplify item retrieval. These locations are also included in the end reports of verified projects.

### Projects
Projects are used to manage the status of items within the system. An item can be marked as 'available,' 'reserved,' or 'sold,' with its status automatically updated based on the associated project's status. Note: It is not necessary to have a project in order to use the system. However, projects are designated to manage either ONLY verified or unverified items, as verified reports are generated through projects.

### Notes about the backend management of Creators
System Overview:
Collections and Sub-Collections Structure:

Sawmills Collection: Contains documents representing each sawmill.
Projects Sub-Collection: Each sawmill document has a sub-collection of projects. This is where projects specific to each sawmill are stored.
Users Collection: Separate collection where user profiles are stored, including sawmill workers and creators.
Creators: Not specifically a sub-collection, but creators are stored in the Users collection with a role type distinguishing them.
Creators and Projects:

Creator Allocation: Creators are assigned to projects within the sawmill's projects sub-collection. This assignment is likely managed through a field in the project documents that references the creator's user ID.
Project Management: Each project document might contain information about which creator is working on it, along with status updates and links to any content the creator produces.
Data Flow and Access Control:

Project Assignment: A creator is allocated to a project by a user with the necessary permissions within the sawmill system. This might involve selecting a creator from a list and assigning them to a project within the sawmill's project sub-collection.
Creator's View and Interactions: Once assigned, creators can access details of the project, update project status, and add content such as images, notes, or other updates.
Access Restrictions: Access to project details and the ability to make updates are likely controlled via Firestore security rules or programmatic checks within the application, ensuring that only assigned creators and authorized sawmill personnel can view or modify project details.
Creators' Work Reporting:

Detailed Project Documents: Each creator might maintain detailed records of their work within a dedicated sub-collection under their user document or linked directly within the project document, depending on how the data needs to be accessed and managed.
End Report Generation: Upon project completion, the system might generate a comprehensive report that includes all relevant data from both the sawmill and the creator's contributions. This could be achieved through cloud functions that aggregate and format data from multiple sources.
Interaction Example:
Project Creation: A sawmill user creates a project document within the sawmill's project sub-collection.
Creator Assignment: The project document is updated to include a reference to a creator's user ID, possibly within a field like assignedCreatorId.
Creator Access: The creator logs in, queries for projects where their user ID matches the assignedCreatorId, and accesses the project details.
Content Addition: The creator adds content to the project, either directly in the project document or within a separate collection linked to the project.
Reporting: On project completion, data from the project and any creator-specific contributions are compiled into a final report accessible to the sawmill and the creator.
This structure facilitates clear separation of roles and responsibilities while ensuring that data flow between creators and the sawmill system is streamlined and secure. The exact implementation details, such as how data is stored, queried, and secured, would depend on specific application requirements and Firestore configurations.
