  const skillstext = "I realized that providing a transparent way to share sustainable forestry practices with end customers was essential, and software would be the key to achieving this. In 2020, I pursued programming studies at the Code Institute."
  const whytext = "While SawmillGo is still in development, each milestone brings us closer to launching a product that empowers forest owners and creators globally. This project is more than softwareâ€”it's a movement toward sustainable forestry."
  const personaltext= "Building cabins, stables, and barns around our farm has given me a deep appreciation for craftsmanship. I also enjoy carving and fine woodwork, and working as a woodwork teacher since 2024 has been incredibly rewarding. I want to share my vision for SawmillGo, which I believe can make a real difference to both the environment and the local economies of small communities."
